# mSocio 🌐✨

Build and explore a modern, minimal social UI prototype — clean layouts, responsive design, and interactive elements powered by vanilla web technologies.

---

### 🚀 Overview
`mSocio` is a static frontend project that showcases the UI/UX of a social platform. It focuses on a polished look-and-feel, smooth interactions, and a componentized page structure using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — perfect for learning, demos, and extending into a full-stack app later.

### 🌟 Features
- **Modern UI**: Clean feed, profile visuals, and story-like elements
- **Responsive Layouts**: Works across desktop and mobile viewports
- **Vanilla JS Interactions**: Lightweight scripts with zero frameworks
- **Asset-Driven Design**: Organized `images/` for quick theming

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — semantic markup
- **CSS3** — modular styles in `index.css`
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — interactivity in `script.js`
- Optional: serve locally with **Python** or **Node.js** for a better dev experience

### 📁 Project Structure
```text
mSocio/
├─ index.html        # Main page
├─ index.css         # Global styles
├─ script.js         # Page interactions
└─ images/           # Asset library (profiles, stories, feeds, logo)
```

### 🛠️ Getting Started

You have two simple options to run the project locally.

#### Option 1: Open directly in a browser
1. Locate `index.html` in the project root
2. Double-click to open it in your default browser

This works, but some browsers restrict certain features when loaded from the file system. If anything looks off, try Option 2.

#### Option 2: Use VS Code’s Live Server extension and click “Go Live”.

### 📦 How to Develop
- Edit `index.html` to change structure and content
- Update `index.css` for colors, spacing, and responsiveness
- Add interactions in `script.js`
- Place new assets under `images/` and reference them with relative paths

Tip: Keep class names descriptive and group related styles for readability.

### 🔮 Future Scope
- Hook up a real backend (Node/Express, Django, or Firebase)
- Authentication flow (login, signup, JWT sessions)
- User profiles with editable bios and settings
- Post creation, comments, likes, and notifications
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA, color contrast, keyboard nav)
- Theming (dark mode, high-contrast mode)
- Componentize with a framework (React/Vue/Angular) if scaling up

### 🙌 Acknowledgements
- Icons and images are placeholders under `images/` for demo purposes
- Thanks to the open web platform for keeping frontend simple and fun 💛

Have fun exploring and customizing mSocio! 🎉
